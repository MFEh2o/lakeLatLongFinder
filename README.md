# lakeLatLongFinder
A simple shiny app to retrieve lat/long coords for lakes.

# Use/launch
There are two ways to run this app.
1) Run it locally. To do this, click the green "Code" download button on the app's main page to download the folder. Then open the file "app.R" in RStudio and click "Run App" at the top right corner of the script window. Or if you're not using RStudio, navigate to the directory where app.R lives:

```
library(shiny)
runApp("app.R"
```

2) The easier way: visit the cloud-hosted version of the app. As of August 2020, you can access it [here](https://gahmkcaryinstitute.shinyapps.io/lakeLatLongFinder/)

Questions? Please email gahmk@caryinstitute.org. I'd be happy to help! I also welcome any feedback, since this app is currently in development.
